# GeneticAlgorithms

* Simple binary test problem: 0-1 knapsack

Elements:
* Initial population: random, for-each allele, heuristic seeding
* Termination: evaluations, clock time, diversity
* Crossover condition: crossover&mutation(either both or none), crossover|mutation(always one)
* Selection: tournament, takeover time(computes the time taken for best string to take over the entire population)
